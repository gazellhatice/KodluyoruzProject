[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]

[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6] .... 1

[16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6]

[2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6]

[2, 16, 18, 22, 27, 6] .... n-1

[2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27] .... n

Big O Notation- worst case
n!= n*(n+1)/2= (n^2+n)/2 => O(n^2)

Time complexity.
best case: the case that all numbers already sorted, O(n)

average case: O(n^2)

worst case: O(n^2)

Which case for 18?
Since it is in the middle of the array 18 is in the scope of the avarage case
